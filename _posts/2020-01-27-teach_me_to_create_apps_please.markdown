From **hopeful** to **student**: A short story. 

It is no surprise that technology powers and creates change in our lives. From advancements in healthcare to faster computer systems, technology can improve many areas, even in those not readily seen.

I knew I wanted to take part. 

I just didn't know how to take part in tech, exactly. Not yet.

Maybe, the most intimidating part of it all was whether I would be any good at it.

I only knew that I had good app ideas.

Some of those ideas led me to discovering entrepreneurs in their early stages of fundraising for their apps. 

So, I became convinced that once I learned the language(s) I would set off to create my own. 

Shortly thereafter, I downloaded apps from the app store to learn coding. 

I reached out to the most tech-saavy people I knew on social media for tips. 

And soon enough, I came across Flatiron willing to teach me the fundamentals of software engineering.

So far, the CLI --short for Command Line Interface-- enabled me to create my own game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

Cheers to my first chapter with Flatiron and its software engineering track!
